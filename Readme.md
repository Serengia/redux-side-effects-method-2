# Redux- Side Effects - Method-2 (Handling Redux Side Effects in using Thunks)

This project demonstrates/shows an example of how to handle **Redux-side-effects** with **redux custom action creators** via the use of **Thunks.**

> _REMEMBER:_ Redux-reducers must be pure, i.e. You can't run side effects generating tasks such as making **HTTP Requests** and **saving/fetching staff to your local storage** inside redux reducers. To run side-effects generating tasks in redux, you can do that in regular react components(of course using **useEffects()** hook) or use **redux custom action creators** via the use of **Thunks** -- something we are doing in this project.

## Running the project

CD into the project directory and run the following command:

```
npm install
```

To use the backend, (and if you have time) you can create your own simple **API endpoints** and replace the **HTTP Requests links** on this project with your own. Alternatively, you can quickly get a **Firebase real-time-database test-link** and use that instead.
